The next step is to modify the bucket policy to allow public access. You can do this by adding a new 
statement to the policy that grants the “s3:GetObject” permission to everyone.

    Navigate to the Permissions tab in your bucket
    Go to Bucket Policy and click Edit
    Add the following statement to the Policy and make sure to change the bucket-name with the name of the bukcet you are working with:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::amplify-junkyard/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

In the above example, we’re granting the “s3:GetObject” permission to everyone by setting the “Principal” field to “*”. 
We’re also specifying that this policy applies to all objects within the bucket by using the wildcard character (*) in the “Resource” field
